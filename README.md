# Nicholas's 100Days Challenge Portfolio
My name is Nicholas Lee and I am a first year at The University of Chicago. 
I am currently currently a prospective Computer Science major with a possible second major in Economics.
In this repository you will find one of my projects, DRINK.ME which is an app to promote safe drinking by tracking a user's BAC.
This is done by using the user's weight and sex. I have done this project for one of my clubs, International Leadership council, where we have been tasked to creating a startup within 100 Days. As the software engineer of my team, I am the one who has been designing and implementing this app using React Native and JSX. 

### Here is a preview of what the app BAC Page looks like: 
Currently we have four drink options all which are one standard drink.This app uses a time component as well, calculating the user's BAC in real time. It also tracks the time since the user's first drink and more recent drink, as well as the user's status to put BAC in a qualitative manor. Once a certain limit is reached, the phone will vibrate until the user acknowledges that the user is approaching a dangerous state of drinking. This is doen using React Alerts and React Vibrate.

### Here is a preview of what the settings page looks like:
The settings page allows users to change their data. Currently we store the user's data using Async-storage, allowing their data to be stored even upon close of the app. The users are able to all the fields using the reset button, which also actively adjusts the BAC in the BAC Page. We have also a stop drinking button, which shuts down the BAC Page adding drink component, allowing the user to monitor their BAC once they have stopped drinking. The reset button resets the time and drink count for when the user wants to reset their data.
