# Nicholas's 100Days Challenge
My name is Nicholas Lee and I am a first year at The University of Chicago. 
I am currently currently a prospective Computer Science major with a possible second major in Economics.
In this repository you will find one of my projects, DRINK.ME which is an app to promote safe drinking by tracking a user's BAC.
This is done by using the user's weight and sex. I have done this project for one of my clubs, International Leadership council, where we have been tasked to creating a startup within 100 Days. As the software engineer of my team, I am the one who has been designing and implementing this app using React Native and JSX.
